 *
 * - `k`: The number of documents to return in the final results. This is the
 *   primary count of documents that are most relevant to the query.
 *
 * - `lambda` (optional): A value between 0 and 1 that determines the balance
 *   between relevance and diversity:
 *   - A `lambda` of 0 emphasizes diversity, maximizing content variation.
 *   - A `lambda` of 1 emphasizes similarity to the query, focusing on relevance.
